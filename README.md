[XML, DTD] Researcher Profile (affiliations + publications) using XML

This repository allows to record the activity of researchers (affiliation and publications) through a defined XML structure.
In addition, it provides a front-end (php) that shows all the publications ordered by year.

FILE LIST:
- rpDTD.dtd - contains all the elements and attributes that the profile needs
- myPub.xml - follow the rules in the dtd file to store information about researchers
- index.php, myCss.css and images - FRONT END

An example of front end has been installed here: http://infernusweb.altervista.org/wp/?page_id=853
